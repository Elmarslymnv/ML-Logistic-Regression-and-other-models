# ML-Logistic-Regression-and-other-models
## In logistic&others.ipynb file , I solved this problem below:
### You asked to create Support Vector Machine (with both Linear and RBF kernel) classifier, Decision
### Tree classifier, Random Forest classifier, Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes classifier, KNN classifier to
### predict whether patients have heart disease or not and decide which algorithm performs the best on
### average.

## In onehotencoder.ipynb file , I solved this problem with onehotencoder below:
### Through given data you should predict whether a person makes less than
### 50K $ in a year.
